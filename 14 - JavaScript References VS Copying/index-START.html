			// Let's say we have an array
			const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

			// and we want to make a copy of it.

			// You might think we can just do something like this:
			const team = players

			// however what happens when we update that array?
			team[3] = 'Lux'

			// now here is the problem!
			console.log(players, team)

			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

			// one way
			const team1 = players.slice()
			// or create a new array and concat the old one in
			const team2 = [].concat(players)
			// or use the new ES6 Spread
			const team3 = [...players]
			const team4 = Array.from(players)

			// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
			team1[0] = 'Ben'
			team2[0] = 'Sam'
			team3[0] = 'Bob'
			team4[0] = 'Dave'
			console.table([players, team1, team2, team3, team4])

			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

			// with Objects
			const person = {
				name: 'Wes Bos',
				age: 80,
				social: {
					twitter: '@wesbos',
					facebook: 'wesbos.developer',
				},
			}

			// and think we make a copy:

			// how do we take a copy instead?
			const dev = { ...person }
			dev.name = 'Wesley Boss'
			dev.social.twitter = '@daboss'
			console.log(person, dev)

			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

			// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
